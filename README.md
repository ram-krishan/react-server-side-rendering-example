  <h1 align='center'>React, Sever Side Rendering</h1>
  <p align='center'>A starter kit for react server side rendering applications.</p>
</p>

## Features

  - 👀 `react` as the view.
  - 🔀 `react-router` v4 as the router.
  - 🚄 `express` server.
  - 🌍 Server Side Rendering.
  - ⛑ SEO friendly - `react-helmet` provides control of the page title/meta/styles/scripts from within your components.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ram-krishan/react-server-side-rendering-example.git my-project
cd my-project
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start-server
```

Now go make some changes to the `src/views` components to see the tooling in action.
